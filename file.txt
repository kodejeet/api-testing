for the first get request we need the api url

url =  https://simple-books-api.click/ 

this one will get the message = {"message":"Welcome to the Simple Books API."}

now there is another endpoint, the /status/ endpoint, returns when provided with the GET request
 msg = {
    "message": "Welcome to the Simple Books API."
}

now, we can also configure the params that we want to GET 


we can also create. collections and there we can have the API url https://simple-books-api.click/ as the 
variables set as baseURL lets suppose , we have to select the scope like env , global , or collections

now there is the intitial value (public, can be shared)and the current value (private) 


// Query Parameters now :

 go to the params to search thru the response we have got , now enter the key value pair accordingly and we can filter 
 out the results : {"id":2,"name":"Just as I Am","type":"non-fiction","available":false}
 
where key = type and value = non-fiction  

more like a database Query and results


// ASSIGNMENT :

{{baseURL}}/books/?limit=4 , returns with only 6 of those books
