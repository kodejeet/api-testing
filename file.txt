for the first get request we need the api url

url =  https://simple-books-api.click/ 

this one will get the message = {"message":"Welcome to the Simple Books API."}

now there is another endpoint, the /status/ endpoint, returns when provided with the GET request
 msg = {
    "message": "Welcome to the Simple Books API."
}

now, we can also configure the params that we want to GET 


we can also create. collections and there we can have the API url https://simple-books-api.click/ as the 
variables set as baseURL lets suppose , we have to select the scope like env , global , or collections

now there is the intitial value (public, can be shared)and the current value (private) 


// Query Parameters now :

 go to the params to search thru the response we have got , now enter the key value pair accordingly and we can filter 
 out the results : {"id":2,"name":"Just as I Am","type":"non-fiction","available":false}
 
where key = type and value = non-fiction  

more like a database Query and results


// ASSIGNMENT :

{{baseURL}}/books/?limit=4 , returns with only 6 of those books (has to be 1-20)


//path variables 

it was -- :bookId, it has a more detailed response

path variables are not similar query Parameters

 
now we want to order books using the book id , but first we have to add our authorization to our variables

created two POST request in the collection. now we have one api-clients and Order Book, 

to use order book we first have to register ourselves as a client. 

go to the api cliets , add {
   "clientName": "kode",
   "clientEmail": "kode@gmail.com"
}

this shall be done in body => raw => JSON > enter

we get a response , accessToken : a very long string

use this same accessToken to create outselves a vairable so that i can be reused overall project

{{accessToken}} as the CURRENT VALUE which is totally private unless shared 

now go to the request tab and select authorization => Bearer Token add the {{accessToken}} 

now we are authorized , we go to the Order Books and then we put this format but the name could be anything : 

{
  "bookId": 1,
  "customerName": "John"
}

the order is placed with a response message : created : true , orderId : some string literal
